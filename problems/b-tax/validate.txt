Problem Validation Form

Please check "Y"s in the box (remove the "N"s) after you finish the task. 

[Y] You wrote a solution independently (w/o looking at the problem setter's solution first). 
[Y] Your code produces the same results on test cases given by problem setter. 
[Y] The problem setter uses a correct algorithm. 
[Y] The problem setter covers corner cases correctly in his code. 
[-] Test data provides good coverage (corner cases, upper bound limit...)
    Note: The test cases are bit weak. I've rewritten the generator.
    !!! PLEASE REVIEW THIS CHANGE !!!
